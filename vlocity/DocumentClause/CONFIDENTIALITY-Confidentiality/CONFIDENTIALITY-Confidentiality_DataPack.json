By way of illustration only, Confidential Information may include this Agreement, trade secrets, know-how, inventions, contractual disclosures, techniques, processes, algorithms, software programs, schematics, software source documents, contracts, customer lists, financial information, sales and marketing plans, information and business plans and other proprietary information, whether or not such information is marked as confidential. Confidential Information shall not include, even if it is marked as such, information that: (i) is already known to the receiving Party at the time of disclosure, which knowledge the receiving Party shall have the burden of proving; (ii) is, or, through no act or failure to act of the receiving Party, becomes publicly known; (iii) is readily observable and / or duplicate by the public; (iv) is legally received by receiving Party from a third party without restriction on disclosure; (v) is independently developed by receiving Party without reference to the Confidential Information of the disclosing Party; or (vi) is approved for release by written authorization of the disclosing Party. In maintaining the confidentiality of the other Party' s Confidential Information, each Party shall use at least the same standard that Party uses for its own confidential information of similar type, and shall take necessary precautions not to disclose such information to any person except its officers, employees or subcontractors, who have a need to know in order to comply with the obligations of this Agreement. Each Party' s officers, employees, and subcontractors shall be bound by the terms of this Section or a similar written agreement with terms no less protective of either Party' s Confidential Information than this Agreement. Each Party acknowledges that any actual or threatened violation of this Section may cause irreparable, non-monetary injury to the disclosing Party, the extent of which may be difficult to ascertain, and therefore agrees that the disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to all other remedies available at law and/or in equity. Nothing in this Section shall prohibit Telecom from disseminating aggregated information that contains no identifiable Subscriber Confidential Information.",
